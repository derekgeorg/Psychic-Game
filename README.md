Homework Assignment #3 - I'm having a tough time with the concepts of JavaScript. I was able to get this working but not entirely sure how, as I only have one If and and else If statement.

I messed with the game reset for about an hour until I determined it was working all along and I just wasn't console.log the output to tell if a new letter was actually being picked.

JavaScript makes me want to drink alcohol.
